In this project, 

1️⃣ I used a 𝗧𝗙-𝗜𝗗𝗙 𝘃𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗿 to convert text data into numerical features.

2️⃣ 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗡𝗮𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗕𝗮𝘆𝗲𝘀 classifier to predict emotions like anger, joy, and fear based on text. 

3️⃣ Achieved an 𝗮𝗰𝗰𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝟵𝟭%, with strong precision, recall, and F1-score.

While it wasn't a high-tech endeavor, it was incredibly fun and insightful! 🚀
